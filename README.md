# The Obnoxious Clock - React Edition

## Story:
My first js application was the obnoxious-clock app, found in my repos. If you happen to take a look at that code, it's just awful, terrible code. The app is also terrible, but I am endeared to it since it's my first one.

While looking through the React documentation, specifically the [state and lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) page, I saw the clock example, and I knew it was time to revisit my old friend, the obnoxious clock. This time, I'll aim to make it a little easier to work with, as well as adding more sinister features.

## Instructions
1. clone the repo
2. run the following command
```
npm install && npm start
```
3. profit?
